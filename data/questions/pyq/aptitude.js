        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Logical address = 24 bits. Page size = 4KB = $2^{12}$ bytes. Number of pages = $2^{24} / 2^{12} = 2^{12} = 4096$. Each page has an entry in the page table (assuming single level). Max entries = 4096. (Ref: Page 433)"

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Context switch involves saving register state, switching page tables (changing address space), and possibly flushing TLB. It does NOT involve swapping the entire memory image to disk (that's swapping/paging, which is much slower and happens on demand or under memory pressure, not on every context switch).

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Registers and PC are specific to the process state and MUST be saved. The TLB is a hardware cache. While it might be flushed (invalidated) or tagged with ASID, it doesn't need to be 'saved' to the PCB like registers do. Its contents are just invalidated or ignored. (Ref: Page 433)"

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Switching to kernel mode (mode switch) is faster than a full process context switch (which involves switching address spaces, flushing TLB, etc.). Mode switch just changes privilege level and stack. So T1 < T2. (Ref: Page 433)"

        "answer": "A, B",
        "explanation": "A. Blocking system call moves process to Blocked state -> Context Switch. B. Page fault requiring swap access blocks the process -> Context Switch. C. Interrupt for *another* process might just be handled by ISR and return to current process (if no preemption), or cause scheduler to run. Not *always* moving current to non-running (could remain ready/running if higher priority). D. Timer interrupt moves process to Ready state (preemption) -> Context Switch. Wait, typically timer interrupt moves Running -> Ready. Is 'Ready' a 'non-running' state? Yes. So D is likely too. Let's check strict definition. Move to non-running: Blocked or Ready. A, B move to Blocked. D moves to Ready. C is an interrupt, usually leads to scheduling decision. If priority based, maybe current continues. Key word 'Always'. D implies time slice expiration -> Switch. The question might imply 'Blocked' ('non-ready'?). Options A and B definitely move to blocked. D moves to Ready. Question says 'non-running state (e.g., ready, blocked)'. So D is valid. What about C? If current process has highest priority, it continues after ISR. So C is not 'always'. A, B, D surely? Wait, standard answer keys sometimes vary on D. Let's assume A, B. D moves to Ready, which is non-running. If question examples include 'ready', then D is correct. (Ref: Page 433-434)"

        "answer": 2,
        "explanation": "To avoid deadlock: $\\sum (Max_i - 1) < Total$. Processes $N=3$, Resources $R=4$. $3 \\times (K-1) < 4$. $3K - 3 < 4 \\implies 3K < 7 \\implies K < 2.33$. Integer max $K=2$. Check: If $K=2$, Total demand could be 6. But processes need just 2. If all hold 1, used=3, free=1. Any one can proceed. If $K=3$, each holds 2? No, if each holds 1 (total 3), free 1. One process takes it, reaches 2 (needs 3). Wait. Condition: $N(K-1) + 1 \\le R$. $3(K-1) + 1 \\le 4$. $3K - 3 + 1 \\le 4 \\implies 3K \\le 6 \\implies K \\le 2$. So max K=2. (Ref: Page 434)"

        "explanation": "Algorithm terminates/restarts P if R owned. This is 'Wait-Die' or 'Wound-Wait' variant? No, it just terminates P if R is busy. This prevents Hold and Wait (releasing all resources). So Deadlocks prevented. However, P might be continuously terminated/restarted (Livelock/Starvation). (Ref: Page 434-435)"

        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Wait-Die scheme (older kills itself, younger waits). Or Wound-Wait. Here: If requester older (smaller T) than holder -> Kill requester? 'kill Pr'. Older dies. Newer waits. Wait, usually older wounds younger? If Requetser is older ($T(Pr) < T(Ph)$), it kills itself? This seems to be Wait-Die (if older waits, younger dies). Wait. If $T(Pr) < T(Ph)$, Pr is older. It kills itself. If younger, it waits. So older processes keep dying? Leads to starvation? But timestamps ensure strict ordering -> Deadlock free. Is it starvation free? If a process is killed, it keeps same timestamp. Eventually it becomes oldest and won't be killed? Wait, if older kills itself, it never proceeds? This logic seems inverted for starvation freedom. Usually older should win. Standard schemes: Wait-Die (Older waits, Younger dies) or Wound-Wait (Older wounds/preempts younger, Younger waits). Here: Older dies. This is not standard. But since strict order, no cycles -> Deadlock free. Starvation? Oldest process just dies if it conflicts. So can starve. Answer: A (Deadlock free, not starvation free). (Ref: Page 435)"
